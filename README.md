Aibel is a leading service company within the oil, gas and offshore wind industries. We provide our customers with optimal and innovative solutions within engineering, construction, modifications and maintenance throughout a project's entire life cycle.

Aibel's Material Master Data (MMD) ontology defines the vocabulary Aibel uses for product classification and description. MMD is master data source for downstream engineering authoring tools, like 3D CAD systems. By using the ontology, Aibel experiences greater precision and data quality in the design phase, which again reduces the total time and cost of construction.

This repository contains the MMD ontology published under the open source licence CC BY 4.0. The ontology has been obscured to protect sensitive information, which is largely done by re-minting IRIs and literals, while still preserving the logical content of the ontology.
